USAGE
	cd LocalDrive/Code/github/music/scripts
	python ./standardizer



Ideas:
sort into folders by name
Use 'letters' for Version? ie, Cats D.1-3? YES!!! eventually...
standardized format
automatically update logic names based on metadata?
move demos from google drive after a time

Standardizer: Versions


The tricky part is whether 2 logic files differ by version or subversion

Idea
Use Logic files date createds to automatically assign versions


1. Group demos in folders by song name
2. Group logics in folders by song name
3. For each demo file, try to match it to its logic file
4. Each logic file of the same name has its own 'mysteryversion - sorted by date created - could differ by version or subversion.'


Mystery version must be done manually... by sorting into folders!!!

sortLogicFiles():
	Read in all LogicFiles
	read in all DemoFiles

	Goal: every demo file has a: 
	Version (logic new starts), 
	Subversion (logic revision), 
	Bounce (new Bounce of a given Subversion) , 

	Options (misc stuff) ... eventually, forks?

class DemoFile
	Version
	Languages 
	Logic File(s)
	Bounce File(s)
	Memo File(s)

	AudioFile[] bounceFiles[]
